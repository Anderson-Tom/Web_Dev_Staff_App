# Web_Dev_Staff_App
Second year assessment, 90 minutes.

This was a 90 minute assessment to build a web app that allowed the user to add employees and eytest results to a database.
It contains a good bit of cheking of birthdays at login and the login behviour is a bit odd with the menu hidden initialy 
and the need to click on a button before you get started but it is what was specified.
