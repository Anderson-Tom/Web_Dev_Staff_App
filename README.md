# Web_Dev_Staff_App
Second year web development assessment, 90 minutes.

This was a 90 minute assessment to build a web app that allowed the user to add employees and eyetest results to a database.
It contains a good bit of checking of birthdays at login and the login behviour is a bit odd with the menu hidden initially 
and the need to click on a button before you get started, but that is what was specified.
